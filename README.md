# Deep-Quant-Time-Series: DNNs for Financial Market Forecasting

An exploration of Deep Neural Networks for time series modeling of noisy financial market data. This project focuses on building various deep learning models and implementing effective feature scaling techniques to handle high-dimensional financial data.

## 1. Project Overview

This project replicates a quantitative research workflow for financial time series analysis. The primary goal is to explore a variety of Deep Learning models to forecast market movements from large-scale, noisy financial data. A key challenge addressed is ensuring these models can effectively scale to handle arbitrarily large and high-dimensional feature sets, a common requirement in quantitative finance.

## 2. Core Objectives

-   To implement and compare various Deep Neural Network architectures (like LSTMs, GRUs, and Transformers) for time series forecasting.
-   To build a robust data processing pipeline for handling noisy financial data.
-   To design and implement "Effective Feature scalability" techniques to manage high-dimensional inputs.
-   To create a backtesting framework to evaluate the performance of trading strategies generated by the models.

## 3. Methodology

#### Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Preprocessing

1.  **Dataset**: Since real high-frequency trading data is proprietary, we'll use publicly available financial data. Good sources include the **`yfinance`** library for stock data or crypto exchange APIs (e.g., Binance, Coinbase) for minute-level price data.
2.  **Feature Engineering**: We'll create a feature set from the raw time series data, including:
    * **Lagged Features**: Past returns and volumes.
    * **Technical Indicators**: Moving Averages (SMA, EMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), MACD.
    * **Volatility Measures**: Rolling standard deviation of returns.
3.  **Feature Scaling**: This is a critical step. The data pipeline will implement and compare different scaling techniques:
    * **StandardScaler**: Standardizes features to have zero mean and unit variance.
    * **MinMaxScaler**: Scales features to a given range (e.g., [0, 1]).
    * **Rank Transformation**: Converts feature values to their rank, making the model robust to outliers.

#### Phase 2: Model Architecture

1.  **Baseline Model**: We'll start with a simple baseline like a Logistic Regression or ARIMA model to benchmark performance.
2.  **Deep Learning Models**: We will implement a variety of architectures in the `/models` directory to perform time series analysis.
    * **LSTM/GRU Networks**: Standard recurrent neural networks ideal for sequence data.
    * **Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs)**: CNN-based models that are effective for time series tasks.
    * **Transformer with Time Series Attention**: An attention-based model to capture long-range dependencies.

#### Phase 3: Training and Backtesting

1.  **Training Pipeline**: We'll develop a `train.py` script that loads the preprocessed data, initializes a chosen model, and trains it to predict the next period's price movement (e.g., a binary classification of up/down).
2.  **Backtesting Engine**: A `backtest.py` script will be created to simulate trading based on the model's predictions. It will iterate through a test set, make trading decisions, and calculate performance metrics like **Sharpe Ratio**, **Maximum Drawdown**, and **Total Return**.
